# gradescope-template-cpp



A minimal template for CSE-3150 TAs to update assignments on gradescope:

**Step1:** Prepare test cases and the solution program. You can use any programming language for the solution, but make sure the necessary software is installed via `setup.sh`.

**Step2:** Update `run_autograder` to handle user input files appropriately. You can compile your CPP files here or defer it to a later step for cleaner compilation scoring.

**Step3: **Modify `tests/test_subprocess.py` to reflect your specific grading criteria.

**Step4:** Zip all the relevant files and upload them to GradeScope.
